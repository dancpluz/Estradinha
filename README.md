## 📚 About



Project made in University of Brasília, for the course "Introdução a Sistemas Computacionais" (Introduction to Computer Systems), in which we learned about machine language assembly RISC-V. The project proposal was to recreate the NES game Road Fighter with assembly RISC-V. We used [RARS](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars) to program, and [FPGRARS](https://github.com/LeoRiether/FPGRARS) to execute the game. 

You can find the more descriptive report, in scientific article model, only in Portuguese [here](report.pdf).
